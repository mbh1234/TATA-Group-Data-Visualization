# Tata Data Visualization Internship  

This repository contains the code, data, and instructions for the Tata Data Visualization Internship, focused on empowering businesses with effective insights through data visualization. The project demonstrates the use of Tableau and Power BI to analyze and visualize retail data, enabling business leaders to make informed decisions.

## Project Overview  
The internship simulated real-world business challenges faced by Tata Insights and Quants (Tata iQ). The tasks involved analyzing retail data with 25,000+ entries to provide actionable insights on consumer behavior, sales trends, customer loyalty, and performance across countries. The internship was divided into four key tasks:

   - Deliverable: Eight key questions for CEO and CMO decision-making.  

2. **Choosing the Right Visuals**:  
   - Select the most effective visuals to represent data based on business requirements.  
   - Deliverable: Answers to scenario-based multiple-choice questions on visual selection.  

3. **Creating Effective Visuals**:  
   - Clean data and create visuals in Tableau or Power BI to analyze trends, customer behavior, and regional demand.  
   - Deliverable: Interactive dashboard and four visuals for specific business scenarios.  

4. **Communicating Insights and Analysis**:  
   - Present findings to leadership with clear context, analysis, and recommendations.  
   - Deliverable: 5-minute presentation video summarizing the process and insights.
